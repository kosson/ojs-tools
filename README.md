# ojs-tools

This repo is a collection of tools needed to solve issue with Open Journal System. It aims to help all those who seek sollutions to data importing/exporting in OJS. It also gives some steps to overcame certain limitations and issues.

The repo gathers scripts created by other fellow colleagues, and some of my own production.

The following scripts and solutions are available.
